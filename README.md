# DeployBot

DeployBot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [AWS Elastic Beanstalk][elastic beanstalk] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

### Setup

Go to your [Custom Integrations](https://www.slack.com/apps/manage/custom-integrations)
page for your Slack instance and set up a new Bot integration. Copy the API
token and save for later.

If running locally, set the following environment variables on your host directly.

- `HUBOT_SEMAPHOREAPP_DEPLOY` - Enter something non-zero to enable deployment commands
- `HUBOT_SEMAPHOREAPP_AUTH_TOKEN` - Enter your Semaphore authorization token
- `HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN` - Enter your Slack token
- `HUBOT_AUTH_ADMIN` - Enter your comma separated list of admin user ids

If running on a hosted service such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you can set the environment 
variables on your apps Software Configuration page.

### Run

Run `npm install` if you have just cloned the repo for the first time, to
install the required dependencies.

Run `run.sh` to start DeployBot.

token. You can invite the bot to whatever channel you want it to be present in.

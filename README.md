# DeployBot

DeployBot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality is
available, etc!

### Setup

Go to your [Custom Integrations](https://www.slack.com/apps/manage/custom-integrations)
page for your Slack instance and set up a new Bot integration. Copy the API
token and save for later.

If running on a hosted service such as Heroku, you can set the Config Variables
on your apps Settings page.

### Run

Run `npm install` if you have just cloned the repo for the first time, to
install the required dependencies.

Run `bin/hubot` to start DeployBot.

### Usage

The bot will now join your Slack instance if you specified the correct API
token. You can invite the bot to whatever channel you want it to be present in.

DeployBot understands the following commands:

- deploybot deploy project - deploys project/master to 'prod'
- deploybot deploy project to server - deploys project/master to server
- deploybot deploy project/branch - deploys project/branch to 'prod'
- deploybot deploy project/branch to server - deploys project/branch to server
- deploybot deployed commit - check if commit has been deployed to default server on default project

- deploybot deployed commit on project to server - check if commit has been deployed to server on project
- deploybot deployed msg - check if commit message has been deployed to default server on default project
- deploybot deployed msg on project - check if commit message has been deployed to default server on project
- deploybot deployed msg on project to server - check if commit message has been deployed to server on project
- deploybot help - Displays all of the help commands that Hubot knows about.
